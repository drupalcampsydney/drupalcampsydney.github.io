<h2>Programme</h2>

<p>We've now lined up a tentative programme for the weekend. Check it out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://tinyurl.com/dcs-roster">http://tinyurl.com/dcs-roster</a></strong></p>

<p>You will notice that we still have a few slots for presentations, BOFs and lightning talks. There's still time to get something up.</p>

<h2>The venue</h2>
<p>The venue is the YHA Katoomba which is conveniently located just down from the main drag and easy walking distance to the Three Sisters, the station, restaurants and other local attractions.</p>
<p>The location of the camp is a large single room which can easily accommodate 40 Drupalistas. There are "cozy corner" couches to chill out on, a hackers area for coding, a presentation area with projector and a kitchen which we have to ourselves. We have access to the room 24/7 so it is available for late night hack fests if you are up for that kind of thing. In short it is a great space which we can make our own.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/blue-mountains/katoomba/">YHA Blue Mountains</a>, Katoomba<br />
<p>207 Katoomba Street<br />
Katoomba 2780</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+BlueMountainsYHAKatoomba/about">Google Place</a></p>

<h2>When</h2>
<p>Saturday 28th to Sunday 29th June 2014</p>
<p>The camp will kickoff at 10am on Saturday, giving Sydneysiders enough time to catch the train to the venue.</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>We are keeping the cost of the event to a minimum for participants. Tickets cost $20 per day. A ticket includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>entry to the event,</li>
  <li>drinks and snacks throughout the day,</li>
  <li>wifi,</li>
  <li>catered lunch,</li>
  <li>a drink at the bar on Saturday night and</li>
  <li>a tshirt!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tickets are limited to 40 people on Saturday and Sunday.</strong> This number should accommodate the Sydney community relatively comfortably given the numbers we get at weekly meetups. As they say, please book early to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>If you want to pick up a free event tshirt please book your tickets by <strong>Saturday, 20th June</strong>.</p>

<h2>Two scholarships remain</h2>
<p>Two scholarship places remain for students, unemployed and for those who need a bit of financial hep to get to the event. A scholarship place includes entry to the event on both days as well as accommodation at the YHA. Total value is around $80. All you need to do is get there.</p>

<p class="author"><a href="https://drupal.org/user/1064636">Anton Baggerman</a></p>

<a name="cross"></a>
<h4>Turning Missing Pieces into Building Blocks: Introduction to Problem-Solving & Solution Architecture in Drupal</h4>
<p class="description">This presentation covers how to break down a project from business requirements into a technical solution that is ready for implementation. For new drupalers, this will help bridge the gap between having a list of modules and how to apply them to solve real problems and achieve any business objectives. </p>
<p class="author"><a href="https://drupal.org/user/35936">Ryan Cross</a></p>

<h4>Image management And Drupal</h4>

<h4>Creating custom layouts with Panels (without pulling your hair out!)</h4>
<p class="description">How to create custom layouts in <a href="https://drupal.org/project/panels" target="_blank">Panels</a> without using its performance hungry and fiddly UI interface. You don't need to be a hardcore backend developer to do this, just know how to cut and paste.</p>
<p class="author"><a href="https://drupal.org/user/627278">Magda Kostrzewa</a></p>

<a name="epstein"></a>
<h4>Drupal 7 theming with Template Field Variables</h4>
<p class="description">The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/tpl_field_vars">Template Field Variables</a> module is a utility module for themers. Its only purpose is to make Drupal template development less painful. It provides "dead-simple variables" rather than Drupal's infamous "massive nested arrays". In this presentation the module author will walk you through how to make your life easier as a themer.</p>
<p class="author"><a href="https://drupal.org/user/15277">Jeremy Epstein</a></p>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<a name="gordon"></a>
<h4>Speaking the same language: Beyond testing with BDD and Behat</h4>
<p class="description">Step 1. Learn how to build sites right, Step 2. ???, Step 3. Build the right site. Building software isn&apos;t really about the bits, it&apos;s a people game. Testing likewise isn&apos;t really all about the tests. Once you get some testing chops now you&apos;re ready for the real fun; communicating goals, outcomes and designs with other people to make sure the right thing is built. This talk will focus on step 2.</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Have your Drupal questions answered. Bring your laptop and site along and one of our volunteers will help you out.</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p>As it is a "camp" we highly recommend the venue itself, the YHA. There are dorm rooms and a limited number of double rooms - all at very reasonable prices. A dorm room is available from around $36. There are a limited number of family rooms available as well. Please book directly with the venue (<a tel="+61247821416">+61 (0)24782 1416</a>). Once again, please book early.</p>

<h2>Unconference</h2>
<p>The camp will be relatively unstructured. If you would like to present, the presentation area is available for short talks less than 30mins long. Lightning talks are welcome as well. We will sort out the running order on the day.</p>
<p>The room will have tables divided into little pods for like minded hackers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>frontend, </li>
  <li>developers,</li>
  <li>help and </li>
  <li>ad hoc bofs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever your Drupal interest, you're sure to find some collaborators.</p>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>Will you want to attend this event? We hope so.</p>
<p>It is open to old hands and newcomers alike. Drupal people love helping others and sharing knowledge. For those <strong>learning</strong> there will be helpers and mentors on hand to answer your questions. If you are <strong>evaluating</strong> Drupal and want to check out the community it is also for you. We'll be happy to talk through what you want to get out of Drupal... and what you can give back too :)</p>

<h2>You make the camp</h2>

<h2>Getting There</h2>

<h3>By Train</h3>
<p>Katoomba is a 2 hour train ride from Sydney Central Station. Trains leave at least hourly from early morning to late at night. See <a href="http://www.transportnsw.info/">Transport NSW</a> for timetable details. The hostel is a 700 metre walk down the main street (Katoomba Street) on the right hand side, located next door to the police station. For those with lots of luggage, a taxi rank is located to the right of the station exit.</p>

<h3>By Car from Sydney</h3>
<p>Take Parramatta Rd west and then the M4 motorway to Emu Plains. This becomes the Great Western Highway that winds west through many of the mountain villages prior to arriving in Katoomba. In Katoomba there is an exit left into Katoomba township that passes over the railway line. Turn left at the first roundabout then right at the second one onto Katoomba Street. The hostel is located on the right just pass the first cross street (Waratah Street), next door to the Police Station.</p>

<h3>By Car from Lithgow or further west</h3>
<p>Take the Great Western Highway east from Lithgow in the direction of Sydney. You will pass through the townships of Mt Victoria, Blackheath and Medlow Bath before entering Katoomba. Turn right over the railway line at the first set of traffic lights in Katoomba, and then follow directions above from the first roundabout.</p>
