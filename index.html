<h1>Drupal Camp Sydney 2014</h1>
<h2>Blue Mountains YHA, Katoomba</h2>
<h2>28th - 29th June 2014</h2>

<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/drupal-camp-sydney-2014-tickets-11298715763?ref=ebtnebtckt"><img src="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/custombutton?eid=11298715763" alt="Eventbrite - Drupal Camp Sydney 2014" /></a>

<h2>The venue</h2>
<p>The venue is the YHA Katoomba which is conveniently located just down from the main drag and easy walking distance to the Three Sisters, the station, restaurants and other local attractions.
<p></p>The location of the camp is a large single room which can easily accommodate 40 Drupalistas. There are "cozy corner" couches to chill out on, a hackers area for collaborative working, a presentation area with projector and a kitchen which we have to ourselves. We have access to the room 24/7 so it is available for late night hack fests if you are up for that kind of thing.</p>
