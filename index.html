<h1>Drupal Camp Sydney 2014</h1>

<p>Drupal Camp Sydney 2014 is being held over two days in the Blue Mountains in June. Make the trip up the mountains to share a weekend with fellow Drupal enthusiasts sharing their knowledge and ideas.</p>

<h2>The venue</h2>

<p>The venue is YHA at Katoomba which is conveniently located just down from the main drag and easy walking distance to the Three Sisters and other local attractions.</p>
<p>The location of the camp is a large single room which can easily accommodate 40 Drupalistas. There are "cozy corner" couches to chill out on, a hackers area for collaborative working, a presentation area with projector and a kitchen which we have to ourselves. We have access to the room 24/7 so it is available for late night hack fests if you are up for that kind of thing.</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>

<p>The event is limited in size to 40 people. Please book early to avoid disappointment. Ticket sales will be opened soon - an announcement will be made once available.</p>
